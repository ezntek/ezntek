# notes
1. i dont update this page very much
2. pls dont look at my stats score (no time because i got school) (went from `A+` to `B-` in a week (??) )

### about me

I use artix linux.

### about me (code)
Main Languages (active use):
* Rust
* C++
* Python
* Python
* C

Other Languages (skills are not fully developed/stale):
* C++
* C (Have to master libc)
* JavaScript/TypeScript (need lots more practice)
* Go (no projects to use it on)

Want to learn/improve on:
* Zig (practicing)
* TypeScript
* Java (have to)
* Go (became too stale)

I can write shell scripts but I dont like writing them

### coding availability status
**what**: gen Z would say "oh hell nah"

**why**: exams soon + beanmaths

### currently working on:

* `ezntek/beanmaths` don't disappoint the people that were hyped.
* `ezntek/beancode` must work on another cursed project that's in rust and that I can flex with
* `ezntek/smbuilder` procrastination
* `ezntek/beanforth` restart, rewrite, reimplement, whatever

### other stuff

* `ezntek/quiz` forced to make
* `ezntek/cursython` is cool (please support)
* `ezntek/SM64LinuxLauncher-qt` is deprecated and a rewrite is being worked on
* `ezntek/whow` is archived because its too much of a dumpster fire (rewrite may happen)

### Todo / Project Bucket List:

* refactor `ezntek/cursython` such that it can be used as a code generation backend
* create my own concatenative programming language with nice syntax
 * compiled (no vm if possible)
* make a darwin AND linux SM64 PC Port launcher (edit: `ezntek/smbuilder`) with a nice GUI
