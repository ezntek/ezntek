### about me
https://ezntek.github.io/about

TL;DR: i use zentuÂ®

### about me (code)
Main Languages (active use):
* Rust (still practicing a lot)
* Python (of course)

Other Languages (skills became stale):
* JavaScript/TypeScript (need more practice)
* Go (no projects to use it on)
* Rust (still not really good at)
* C (too scared to touch now)
* C++ (even more scared)

Want to learn/improve on:
* Rust (still improving)
* Go (skills became stale and no projects to use it on)
* TypeScript

I can write shell scripts but I dont like writing them

### coding availability status
**what**: cannot (maybe can a bit because i have breaks)

**why**: exams

### currently working on:

* `ezntek/smbuilder` full speed development

### other shit

* `ezntek/SM64LinuxLauncher-qt` is deprecated and a rewrite is being worked on
* `ezntek/nautilus_vm` is a slow speed development side project (language vm, may reuse later)
* `ezntek/whow` is archived because its too much of a dumpster fire (rewrite may happen)

### Todo / Project Bucket List:

* make a build system that revolves around python scripts
* write a catppuccinifier (yes a rust one already exists but that depends on webkit-gtk and web apps suck)
* make a darwin AND linux SM64 PC Port launcher (edit: `ezntek/smbuilder`)
* design a register machine vm bytecode
* implement a vm for the bytecode (going backwards, but `ezntek/nautilus_vm`)
* make a language to compile to the bytecode
* Spam-In-A-Can-Man discord bot
* SSG
