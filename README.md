### about me

I use artix linux.

Other Languages (skills are not fully developed/stale):
* C++

### currently working on:

* `ministopwatch` (offline for now) minimal terminal stopwatch app for power users
* `BeanwareHQ/beanlife` (half baked) possible curses TUI?
* `BeanwareHQ/beanmaths` (restarted) don't disappoint the people that were hyped.
* `ezntek/smbuilder` (half baked) rewrite in C or add a GUI

### other stuff

nothing interesting...I always lose my motivation to finish projects so none for you to see unfortunately

* `ezntek/quiz` forced to make
* `ezntek/cursython` is cool (please support)
* half baked crate `ezntek/smbuilder`


### Todo / Project Bucket List:

* get motivation
* learn GTK
* learn OpenGL/SDL
* learn Vue.js (sigh)
* refactor `ezntek/cursython` such that it can be used as a code generation backend
* implement a simple programming language that transpiles to C
* create my own concatenative programming language with nice syntax
 * compiled (no vm if possible)
* make a darwin AND linux SM64 PC Port launcher (edit: `ezntek/smbuilder`) with a nice GUI
* Audio visualizer (with FFTs!)
