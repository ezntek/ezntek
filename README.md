(new for 2025!) im just a silly guy who makes dumbass projects. genuniely nothing very interesting nor remarkable, all the cool ideas and skill i bear are on paper or are on intangible media. so nothing cool unless if im really proud. if im really proud it will be all over the place

# notes
1. i dont update this page very much
2. pls dont look at my stats score (no time because i got school) (went from `A+` to `B-` in a week (??) )

### about me

My name is Eason Qin. I have studied in Singapore since 2015, and am a resident here. I love programming a lot; if you are in my school or are in any of my classes, you will catch me slacking off and coding, because worksheets can be done after school, but urgent bug fixes or implementing cool ideas are more important to me :D

I prefer the C programming language for anything and everything, but recently, I've been dabbling in more Python than I've ever wanted to, due to `ezntek/beancode`, a tiny, portable, but feature-rich IGCSE Pseudocode interpreter. I will be writing more C projects soon, and polishing my very own scripting language written in C.

### about me (code)
Main Languages (active use):
* C
* Python
* Zig
* Rust
* Java (don't want to use it)

Other Languages (skills are not fully developed/stale):
* Odin
* D
* JavaScript/TypeScript (need lots more practice)
* Go (no projects to use it on)
* Vue.js
* C++

Want to learn/improve on:
* Odin
* D
* C++

### What can I do?
* Compiler/Interpreter development and optimizations
* Developing CLI tools for Linux (eventually GUIs)
* Basic web development
* Basic game development and graphics programming with raylib and C
* Educating others about computer science (despite how I'm horrible at it)

I can also write shell scripts but I dont like writing them
